    After downloading this file, you may see blank pages in the documentation. 
    That's because Windows is blocking CHM files for security reasons. 
    Fixing this problem is easy:

        * Right-click the CHM file, select properties, then click “Unblock”.
        * Or compress the CHM file into a zip archive and decompress it in 
          another directory.
        * Do not open the CHM file on a network drive.
